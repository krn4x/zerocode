# ZeroCode - Stop Writing Bad AI Code

ðŸ›‘ **THE PROBLEM**: You watched YouTube videos saying "AI will code everything for you!"  
You bought Cursor/Claude/Copilot subscriptions. You spent months in a death spiral.  
Nothing works. Your code is a mess.

âœ… **THE SOLUTION**: Run ONE command. Your AI instantly becomes 10x better.

## How It Works (30 seconds to better AI)

```bash
npm install -g zerocode
cd your-project
zerocode activate
```

That's it. Your AI now follows battle-tested principles from:

- **Rich Hickey** (Clojure creator) - Simple > Complex
- **Linus Torvalds** (Linux creator) - Real Problems > Imaginary Ones  
- **Zeus Method** - Structured thinking patterns for complex problems

### AFTER ZeroCode:
- AI writes simple, working code
- Solutions you can actually understand
- Code that doesn't break tomorrow
- Focus on real problems, not theoretical BS
- Structured approach to complex tasks

## Core Methods

### ðŸ§  Zeus Method - Advanced Problem Solving
For complex tasks requiring structured coordination:

```bash
# Analyze your project and create Zeus orchestrator
zerocode zinit
```

**What Zeus Method Does:**
- **Orchestrates complex problems** with structured breakdown
- **Three-phase approach**: Orchestrator â†’ Specialist â†’ Evaluator
- **Quality control** with built-in feedback loops
- **Handles parallelization** for large-scale tasks

**When to Use Zeus:**
- Multi-component features
- System architecture decisions
- Complex debugging scenarios
- Large refactoring projects
- Performance optimization tasks

The Zeus method creates an agentic loop that can tackle any complex task with minimal role bloat:

1. **Zeus (Orchestrator)** - Breaks down problems and coordinates everything
2. **Poseidon (Specialist)** - Applies domain expertise to each component
3. **Athena (Evaluator)** - Grades outputs and provides feedback until quality â‰¥ 90%

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Activate ZeroCode for your project
zerocode activate

# Analyze project and create Zeus orchestrator
zerocode zinit

# Generate custom prompts
zerocode generate --platform claude --complexity advanced

# See before/after examples
zerocode demo
```

## Why This Works

Most developers feed AI tools garbage prompts, so they get garbage code. ZeroCode gives your AI proven frameworks:

1. **Simple > Easy** (Hickey) - Don't overcomplicate things
2. **Real > Theoretical** (Linus) - Solve actual problems
3. **Structured > Chaotic** (Zeus) - Break down complex problems systematically

## Installation
